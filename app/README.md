# RESTful App

A RESTful API for an uptime monitoring application.

The purpose is to allow users to enter URLs they wish to monitor and receive alerts for status changes when resources 'go down' or 'come online'.


## Technology

This API is built with only Node.js.

## Implementation

The codebase follows along with Module 3 of the course. Some modifications are applied to the code due to personal preference in writing. The course uses ES5 whereas I implement some ES6+ features. 

## Environments

The API has two environments, _staging_ and _production_.

## Commands

- Run `node index.js` from this directory to run the server.

- Run `NODE_ENV=production node index.js` to run the server in prod mode.


## Product modifications

The course was originally designed for ES5, however, I have used alternative code style due to personal preference and ease of ES6+.
